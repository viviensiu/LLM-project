When connections to active instance are interrupted, the failover to standby gateway will take a few seconds (for planned maintenance) or within 90s (for unplanned interruptions).\n**Active/active**: Assign a unique public IP address to each instance, and create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address.\n**ExpressRoute failover**: ExpressRoute circuits have resiliency built in but could be affected by issues on physical cables or outages. A VPN gateway can be a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections.\n**Zone-redundant gateways**: VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration for regions that offer availability zones.
